# Icarus

Icarus started as an design for a tweak by [Devy Design](https://twitter.com/Devy_Design) originally named Kangaroo.

Icarus is a complete overhaul of iOS' multitasking gesture system. It replaces the traditional app switcher with a custom one, capable of much more than stock iOS. By using system gestures to smoothly integrate Icarus, using it should be second nature. Originally a paid tweak, it is now free due to a few minor bugs, repo choice and internal disagreements, and therefore donations are greatly appreciated - [MTAC](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mtac) - [Devy Design](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/devydesign)
